# SheepDB

SheepDB is a lightweight service that uses Google Spreadsheets as a storage backend. It provides both a CLI interface and an API server for managing your data.

## Features

- üîÑ Use Google Spreadsheets as a database
- üöÄ Simple CLI interface for data management
- üåê RESTful API server
- üìä Easy data querying and manipulation
- üîê Secure authentication for API endpoints

## Prerequisites

- Google Cloud Project with enabled Google Sheets API
- Google Service Account credentials

For detailed instructions on setting up these prerequisites, please refer to our [Setup Guide](./HOW-TO.md).

## Installation

You can download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/openais-io/sheepdb/releases).

## Configuration

Configure the required environment variables by either setting them directly or using a .env file located in the same directory as the SheepDB executable:

```bash
GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-service-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY=your-service-account-private-key # You can get the value from the service-account.json file
GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID=your-spreadsheet-id
API_KEY=your-api-key  # Required for API server
```

**IMPORTANT:** After configuring your environment variables, remember to grant "Editor" access to your Google Spreadsheets for the email address specified in GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL.

## CLI Usage

SheepDB provides several commands for managing your spreadsheet data.

```bash
sheepdb --help
```

### Sheet Management

```bash
# Get sheet data
sheepdb sheet get <sheet-name>

# Create a new sheet
sheepdb sheet create <sheet-name> --columns "column1,column2,column3"

# Delete a sheet
sheepdb sheet delete <sheet-name>

# Add a row to a sheet
sheepdb sheet add-row <sheet-name> --data "value1,value2,value3"

# More detail
sheepdb sheet --help
```

### API Server

Start the API server:

```bash
sheepdb api-server start --port 9091
```

## API Endpoints

The API server provides RESTful endpoints for interacting with your spreadsheet:

- `GET /api/v1/sheets/:name` - Get sheet data
- `POST /api/v1/sheets` - Create a new sheet
- `DELETE /api/v1/sheets/:name` - Delete a sheet
- `POST /api/v1/sheets/:name/rows` - Add a row to a sheet

API documentation is available at `/docs` when running the server.
